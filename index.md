# iSO595 - a genome-scale metabolic model for _Prochlorococcus_
Read about the development and use of this model in 

[Ofaim, S., Sulheim, S., Almaas, E., Sher, D., & Segr√®, D. (2021). Dynamic allocation of carbon storage and nutrient-dependent exudation in a revised genome-scale model of Prochlorococcus. Frontiers in genetics, 12, 91.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.586293)

# Memote report
The memote report for iSO595v7 is found [here](https://github.com/segrelab/Prochlorococcus_Model/blob/master/Model_files/memote.html). Not that the biomass - scaling is not computed correctly by Memote because the biomass-reaction (_BIOMASS_) only consumes macromolecules (pseudo-metabolites) that are assembled in designated reactions (e.g. all proteins, nucleic acids etc).
